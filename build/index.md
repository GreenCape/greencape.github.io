This project provides a standardized layout and process for development of multi-version
extensions. It supports

  - integration tests on different Joomla! versions
  - documentation generation
  - quality measuring
  - and much more.

Although this environment is developed for and only tested with Joomla!, it is not restricted
to that CMS.
